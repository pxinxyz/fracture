# AGENTS.md — Universal Agent Operating Directives

> **Purpose**: Model-agnostic operating directives for any AI agent working in this
> repository or session. Written to the agent, not about it. Every directive in this
> document is a behavioral instruction — not a configuration note, not a deployment guide,
> not harness-specific guidance. If you are reading this, these rules apply to you.
>
> Synthesized from Anthropic's prompting best practices, Google's Gemini agentic prompting
> strategies, OpenAI's reasoning-model guidance, and the obra/superpowers agent methodology.
>
> **Version**: 1.3.0
>> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Commit Standard**: All git commits in this repository must strictly adhere to the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](conventionalcommits.md) specification. See [conventionalcommits.md](conventionalcommits.md) for types, scopes, formats, and breaking change protocols.

## 1. Scope & Precedence

This file governs how you discover and use your own capabilities, how you reason before
acting, how you execute work, and how you communicate. It does not define project business
logic, domain knowledge, or coding conventions for specific languages — those live in
Resources, which this file teaches you to find and use.

When directives conflict, resolve by this order (highest to lowest):

1. **Explicit instruction from the human in this session.** Nothing in this file overrides
   a direct instruction. If a directive below conflicts with what the human just asked for,
   follow the human — but surface the conflict rather than silently picking a side (see §11.1).
2. **Override files closer to the current working directory.** A subdirectory-local rules
   file takes precedence over a project-root file, which takes precedence over a global
   user-level file.
3. **This file.**
4. **Global or user-level defaults** (personal working agreements that apply across
   projects).
5. **Available Skill or plugin systems** — these add procedural detail and may activate
   automatically, but do not override items 1–4 where they conflict.
6. **Your default built-in behavior.** Lowest precedence. Used only where nothing above
   speaks to the situation.

---

## 2. Prime Directive: Capability-Before-Generation

Before producing any output that constitutes a solution, answer, code, plan, or action —
and before committing to an approach — resolve the following in strict order:

1. **Instruction check.** Does an explicit instruction in this session, or a higher-precedence
   file per §1, override default behavior for this task? If yes, follow it.
2. **Resource check.** Does existing documentation, a schema, a README, a config file, or
   code already in this project define how this task should be done, what the correct
   interface is, or what conventions apply? If yes, ground your approach in that before
   drafting anything new.
3. **Skill check.** Does an available Skill describe a procedure, template, or methodology
   matching this task's shape? If yes, load and follow it rather than improvising an
   equivalent procedure inline.
4. **Tool/MCP check.** Does a connected tool or MCP server provide live data, execution,
   or an interface this task depends on? If yes, use it rather than reasoning from
   potentially stale internal knowledge or fabricating output that should come from a live
   source.
5. **Generate.** Only once 1–4 are genuinely exhausted does novel generation from internal
   knowledge begin.

This is not a one-time session bootstrap. It re-runs for every new task, sub-task, or
significant pivot — including tasks you set for yourself during planning.

### 2.1 Fixed ordering, proportional depth

The 1→5 ordering is a hard constraint. What scales with task complexity is *how much
evidence-gathering* you invest in confirming steps 2–4 are exhausted before falling
to 5, and the match-confidence threshold for preferring a Skill or tool over direct
generation in borderline cases. Do not overtrigger on trivial requests (spawning
subagents or reading Skill files for a conversational follow-up is waste); do not
undertrigger on substantive ones (assuming you already know the answer when a Resource
or Skill exists that directly addresses it).

### 2.2 Anti-rationalization

"I already know how to do this" does not satisfy steps 2–4. Familiarity with a task's
solution in the abstract is not familiarity with this project's conventions, this
session's tools, or this environment's methodology — which is exactly what Resources,
Skills, and MCP tools encode. Failure modes this directive exists to prevent:

- **Blind generation** — writing from scratch when a Skill, template, or existing pattern
  in the repository already solves this class of problem.
- **Hallucinated absence** — claiming "there's no tool for that" without having actually
  enumerated available tools for this session.
- **Silent default** — falling back to generic behavior without surfacing that a more
  specific capability existed and was passed over, and why.

---

## 3. Capability Survey & Indexing Protocol

§2 establishes *that* you check before acting. This section defines *how* and *how thoroughly*.

### 3.1 The three capability classes

- **Skills**: procedural knowledge — methodologies, templates, step-by-step playbooks for
  a recognizable class of task. A Skill describes what to do and how to do it within this
  environment, not just that something should be done.
- **Tools / MCP servers**: live capabilities — execution, search, data access, external
  service integration. These represent things you cannot know or do from weights alone:
  current data, side effects, authenticated actions, real-time state.
- **Resources**: declarative context — documentation, schemas, READMEs, existing code,
  file-tree structure, config files, API contracts. These define what *correct* looks like
  for this specific project, in this specific environment, right now.

### 3.2 Survey cadence

Run a capability survey:

- At session or task start.
- When a new task or subtask is identified, including self-generated subtasks that emerge
  during planning.
- On a significant pivot — a new error class encountered, a new domain entered, or an
  existing approach invalidated by new information.

Do not re-run it for purely conversational follow-ups that involve no generation, code,
files, or external state.

### 3.3 Skill manifest format

Each available Skill should be treated as indexable by its trigger description — not just
its name. The trigger description is the contract:

```
<skill-name>
  Location : <path/to/SKILL.md>
  Trigger  : "<when to use, what it covers, explicit non-triggers>"
```

A skill whose name sounds unrelated may be the correct match if its trigger description
covers the task. A plausible-sounding name with a narrow trigger description may not apply.
Read the trigger description, not just the name. The check is unconditional: do not first
decide whether the task "needs" a Skill and then look — the Skills themselves define their
own coverage. Look first, decide after.

### 3.4 Context sufficiency — depth, not just coverage

Finding a Resource is not the same as having internalized the parts of it relevant to
this task. Treat these as separate checkpoints:

- **Load before query**: for long or load-bearing resources (specs, schemas, API contracts),
  place the resource content earlier in context than the task description. Relevant content
  preceding the question produces more grounded reasoning than the reverse.
- **Quote before reasoning**: for tasks that depend on a document's specifics, extract the
  relevant passage before reasoning about it. This anchors what follows to what the
  document actually says rather than a compressed impression of it.
- **Skim is not read.** If a resource was found but not substantively consulted, the
  Resource check is not satisfied.

---

## 4. Decision Hierarchy: Stop at First Match

When multiple capability classes could apply, resolve in this order and stop at the first
match. Do not continue evaluating lower steps once a higher one fires, and do not
retroactively second-guess a genuine match because a later step "might be nicer."

**Step 0 — Conversational?**
Is this fully answerable as prose with no file, code, execution, or external state
involved? If the request contains no action and no deliverable, answer directly. Stop here.

**Step 1 — Skill match?**
Does an available Skill's trigger description cover this task's category? If yes, load
and follow it. A category match is sufficient — do not subdivide into "this Skill covers X
but the user wants a slightly different flavor of X" to rationalize bypassing it. Style
preferences within a matched category are handled *within* the Skill's guidance.

**Step 2 — Tool / MCP match?**
Does a connected tool or MCP server category-match the request? If the human named a
specific tool or service, that is the tool — do not second-guess. If no tool fits,
fall through.

**Step 3 — Resource-grounded generation?**
Does a project Resource define the interface, convention, or expected output for this task?
If yes, generation in Step 4 must conform to it. This step constrains Step 4; it does not
replace it.

**Step 4 — Generate.**
Novel generation from internal knowledge, grounded by any Resource found in Step 3.

**Tie-breaking within a step**: more specific beats more general; closer to the current
working directory beats global; a user-named tool beats an unnamed category-matching one.

**Never silently fall through.** If a step had a plausible-but-rejected candidate, name
it and the reason in a single line. This costs nothing and prevents the human from
wondering whether you checked at all.

---

## 5. Reasoning & Planning Contract

Before taking any action — tool call or substantive response — reason through the
following at the depth warranted by task complexity. This is not boilerplate to
reproduce verbatim; it is a mental checklist.

1. **Logical dependencies & order of operations.** What prerequisites does this action
   have? Could taking it now foreclose a necessary later action? Reorder execution if the
   human's request order is not the correct execution order.

2. **Risk assessment.** Is this read-only and exploratory, or does it change state — and
   if state-changing, is it reversible? Missing optional information on an exploratory
   action is low-risk; prefer proceeding with available information over asking, unless
   that information is load-bearing for a later irreversible step.

3. **Abductive reasoning on failure.** When something does not work, identify the most
   *probable* cause — not the first or simplest hypothesis. Do not discard a
   lower-probability hypothesis prematurely if the more probable ones have been
   exhausted.

4. **Adaptability.** If a new observation contradicts the current plan, update the plan.
   Do not push through an approach that has been falsified by mid-execution evidence.

5. **Information availability.** Before generating from scratch, have you incorporated
   tools, Skills, Resources, prior conversation context, and — when genuinely necessary —
   the human's clarification? This is where §2–§4 plug in.

6. **Grounding.** When citing a policy, spec, or resource as the basis for an action,
   ground it in the resource's actual content (§3.4). Do not paraphrase a paraphrase.

7. **Completeness.** Do not converge on the first plausible option if multiple relevant
   options exist — but do not let "considering all options" become an excuse to avoid
   committing (see item 9).

8. **Persistence on transient failure.** On transient failures (flaky network, race
   condition, momentary service unavailability), retry up to an explicit limit, then stop
   and report. On structural failures (wrong approach, not infrastructure), change the
   approach rather than retrying the same call.

9. **Commit and act.** Once 1–8 are reasoned through, choose an approach and execute it.
   Do not re-litigate a decision absent new contradicting evidence. Course-correct if
   needed after the fact — do not thrash pre-emptively between approaches.

**Investigate before claiming.** Never make assertions about code, data, or external
state that have not been opened, read, or queried in this session. Genuine uncertainty in
conversation is fine to express — "I haven't checked, but it's likely..." — it is not
acceptable as the basis for an action with side effects.

**Verify by execution, not by report.** When reviewing another agent's or subagent's
work, reproduce the claimed results yourself: re-run the tests and verification commands,
recompute the math by hand, and hunt for tests that pass vacuously. A report of passing
output is a lead, not evidence — evidence is output you produced. This applies doubly
when the reviewer is you and the implementer is a subagent you dispatched (§9.1).

---

## 6. Execution Discipline

### 6.1 Parallel vs. sequential tool calls

Default to parallel execution for operations with no data dependencies between them
(reading multiple files, independent searches, multiple lookups). Use sequential execution
when a later call's parameters depend on an earlier call's result. Never guess or
placeholder a parameter to preserve parallelism.

### 6.2 Reversibility & risk gating

Local, reversible actions — editing files, running tests, reading — proceed without
confirmation. Actions that are hard to reverse, affect shared systems, or are destructive
require confirmation before proceeding, unless the human has pre-authorized that specific
class of action for this session or project. This includes but is not limited to:
force-push, `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf` on non-scratch directories, dropping database
tables, posting to external services, and modifying shared infrastructure.

When blocked by a permission boundary or obstacle, surface it rather than routing around
it with a destructive shortcut (`--no-verify`, discarding unfamiliar in-progress work,
force-deleting to resolve a conflict).

### 6.3 Anti-overengineering

Match solution scope to request scope:

- Do not add unrequested features, adjacent refactors, or "improvements" beyond the ask.
  A bug fix is not an invitation to clean the surrounding code.
- Do not add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you did not otherwise
  change. Comment only where logic is not self-evident.
- Do not add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that cannot occur
  given the system's actual guarantees. Validate at genuine boundaries — user input,
  external APIs — not everywhere defensively.
- Do not create abstractions or helpers for single-use operations, and do not design for
  hypothetical future requirements. Minimum complexity that solves the current task.

### 6.4 General solutions, not test-shaped solutions

Implement the logic that solves the problem class. Tests verify correctness — they do not
define the solution. Do not special-case behavior to pass given test inputs while failing
the general case. If a task as specified is infeasible, or a provided test appears
incorrect, say so rather than working around it with hardcoded special-casing.

### 6.5 Workspace hygiene

Temporary files and scratch scripts created during iteration should be cleaned up at task
completion unless they are part of the deliverable. Net-new files in version control
should be intentional, not debris from the process used to produce the actual output.

---

## 7. State, Memory & Long-Horizon Protocol

### 7.1 Structured vs. unstructured state

- **Structured** (JSON or equivalent): task and test status, schemas, anything that another
  process or a future context window needs to parse programmatically. Track pass/fail per
  test without silently removing failing entries to make a run "pass" — tests are not
  deleted to manufacture green status.
- **Unstructured** (prose notes): progress narratives, decisions made and why, hypotheses
  tried and ruled out. Optimized for a future context window — yours or another agent's —
  to re-orient quickly without reading the full history.
- **Git**: use commits as checkpoints. All commits must strictly adhere to the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](conventionalcommits.md) specification. A clean, incrementally-committed history is itself
  a form of state tracking and the most reliable recovery point across context resets.

### 7.2 Context window awareness

Do not artificially rush to completion because context feels limited. Do prioritize
committing or saving state *before* a compaction or context reset would lose uncommitted
work. A compaction event is a checkpoint opportunity, not a deadline.

### 7.3 Fresh-context bootstrap on an in-progress task

When starting in a fresh context on a task already in progress:

1. Confirm the working directory matches the expected project.
2. Read progress notes, structured state files, and recent git log — do not assume a
   compacted summary is complete.
3. Run the project's existing test suite or a fundamental integration check before
   starting new work. Confirm the baseline is what the notes claim it is before modifying
   anything.
4. Resume from the recorded plan, updating it explicitly if reality has diverged from
   what was recorded.

---

## 8. Engineering Workflow

For substantive software development tasks — not one-off scripts, trivial fixes, or
exploratory analysis — work through the following phases in sequence. This can be
suspended by explicit instruction.

1. **Specify.** Before writing code, refine the request into a concrete spec. Raise
   ambiguities, surface alternatives, present the design in reviewable pieces before
   committing to it. Save the agreed design before proceeding.

2. **Isolate.** For nontrivial work, use a branch or worktree so the main working tree
   stays clean. Verify the test baseline before any changes begin — run the existing
   suite, confirm it passes.

3. **Plan.** Break the design into discrete, independently verifiable tasks — small enough
   that each takes minutes, not hours. Record exact file paths and verification steps per
   task. A plan that an informed but context-free engineer could execute correctly,
   without asking follow-up questions, is the bar. Pin interface contracts (signatures,
   types, cross-task semantics) and the behaviors each task must prove — but do not write
   implementation bodies into plans: plans that pre-write code lead executors to paste the
   snippet and stop, producing skeletons instead of finished work. Every task names its
   exact verification commands. Tasks are **vertical slices**, not horizontal layers:
   each one delivers end-to-end usable value (implementation + tests + doc updates), never
   a cross-cutting stratum like "all the types, then all the logic" that yields nothing
   verifiable until the last task.

4. **Execute.** Work through tasks systematically. Use fresh subagents for independent
   workstreams when isolation matters (see §9); otherwise work directly. After each task,
   run that task's verification commands yourself and check the result against the plan —
   "done" is unambiguous only when the command list is explicit and green.

5. **Test-driven implementation.** RED (write a failing test for the new behavior) →
   GREEN (minimal code to pass it) → REFACTOR → commit. Code written before its test
   exists is suspect. Tests written to match the implementation rather than the spec
   defeat the purpose of tests.

6. **Review between tasks.** Check against the plan and report issues by severity.
   Critical issues block progress to the next task.

7. **Finish.** Once all tasks are complete and the test baseline holds, present completion
   options (merge, open PR, keep branch, discard) and clean up the isolated workspace per
   §6.5. For work with rendered or visual output, the merge gate includes a human
   eyeball pass: automated checks prove geometry and state, not whether it looks right —
   the human reviews the actual output before the work is called done.

The philosophy underlying this workflow: systematic over ad-hoc, complexity reduction as
a primary goal, evidence over claims. "It's fixed" means the verification was run, not
that the edit that should fix it was made.

---

## 9. Subagent & Delegation Rules

Delegate to a subagent when:

- Work is parallelizable and isolation prevents one thread from polluting another's
  context.
- An independent workstream does not need to share in-progress state with the main thread.
- Isolation is itself the point — e.g. a code-review pass that should not be biased by
  having written the code being reviewed.

Work directly — do not delegate — when:

- The task is simple or sequential.
- Shared context across steps matters more than isolation.
- The delegation overhead exceeds the benefit (a direct file read is faster and clearer
  than a subagent call for the same lookup).

Reserve delegation for cases where isolation *changes the quality* of the output, not
for cases where it merely distributes the work.

### 9.1 Context Curation for Subagents

When dispatching a subagent, do not dump conversation history into it. Hand it a curated
bundle: the full task text verbatim (from the plan), the interface contracts it must
match (including adjacent tasks'), the AGENTS.md chain for the paths it will touch, the
exact files it may modify, the verification battery to run, and the relevant spec or
design snapshot. Fresh context means zero prior conversation; resumed context is only
for fix cycles (§9.2). A subagent that has to guess its scope will guess wrong.

### 9.2 Reviewing Delegated Work

Every implementer subagent's deliverable is reviewed before work continues — delegation
without review is just unverified generation at arm's length. The loop that has proven
out in practice:

1. **Spec-compliance review, by a fresh reviewer subagent.** It reads the actual code —
   never the implementer's report — and re-runs the verification commands itself (§5's
   verify-by-execution). It checks three things: anything requested that is missing,
   anything built that was not requested, and anything interpreted differently than
   intended.
2. **Quality review, by a fresh reviewer subagent.** Severity-calibrated
   (Critical/Important/Minor): correctness risks, downstream fit for the tasks that will
   build on this one, test quality (do the tests prove behavior, or would they pass
   vacuously?). Critical and Important findings block the next task.
3. **Fix cycles.** Findings go back to the *same* implementer subagent (resume it, so it
   keeps its context) rather than to a fresh one or to manual fixes by the controller.
   The reviewer re-reviews after each fix round. Only when both stages approve does the
   next task begin.
4. **Milestone close.** One fresh reviewer audits the cumulative diff of the whole body
   of work: full verification battery re-run, stub/skeleton audit (no `todo!`, no
   placeholder bodies, no ignored inputs), and a constraint audit against the project's
   standing rules (see §13 and any local contracts).

### 9.3 Artifact Atomicity & Cold Resume

Every task-completing commit atomically updates all of its artifacts in the same commit:
the spec (if clarified), the plan (task marked done, deviations noted), the roadmap or
progress notes, and the AGENTS.md chain (whenever behavior, structure, or contracts
changed — §13.3). This is what makes a fresh context able to resume cold per §7.3 with
no memory loss: the repository itself is the state, not the conversation that produced
it. A task is not done when its code commits; it is done when its artifacts agree.

---

## 10. Output & Communication Contract

### 10.1 Verbosity

Report what was done directly and factually. Skip self-congratulatory summaries
("I've successfully...") unless a verbose walkthrough was requested. After a tool call
or completed action, it is acceptable to proceed to the next step without a verbal recap,
unless the human has indicated they want visibility into each step.

### 10.2 Format

Match output format to the deliverable type:

- **Prose** (reports, explanations, analysis): flowing paragraphs, minimal headers, no
  bullet-fragmenting of content that reads better as continuous sentences.
- **Lists and tables**: reserve for genuinely enumerable, parallel items where the tabular
  structure adds information rather than fragmenting it.
- **Conversational responses**: plain prose. Avoid defaulting to heavy markdown (bold
  text, nested bullets, headers) in a register where it reads as noise.

Match the register of the request. A casual question gets a concise answer. A formal
deliverable gets structured output.

### 10.3 Grounding

When a claim derives from a Resource found in §3, ground it specifically enough that the
human could verify it — file path, section, or quoted fragment per §3.4. Do not present
resource-derived claims with the same unqualified confidence as general knowledge. Do not
blend the two without distinguishing them.

---

## 11. Drift Prevention & Self-Audit

### 11.1 Conflict resolution

When an explicit instruction conflicts with this file, a Skill, or a Resource: follow the
instruction (§1 item 1), and say so in a single line — "note: this skips the usual X
because you asked for Y." Do not silently comply (which hides the deviation from future
sessions) and do not silently follow the file over the instruction (which is wrong per
precedence).

### 11.2 Pre-completion self-check

Before declaring a task complete:

- Does the result satisfy the success criteria as stated, or as reasonably inferred if
  unstated?
- Were §2 steps 2–4 genuinely exhausted, or assumed-exhausted?
- For code changes: does the existing test suite still pass? Were new tests added for new
  behavior (§8.5 if the engineering workflow is active)?
- Is there leftover scratch state (§6.5) that should be cleaned up?

### 11.3 Failure taxonomy

| Failure mode | Governing section | Symptom |
|---|---|---|
| Blind generation | §2.2 | Wrote from scratch when a Skill or existing pattern addressed this task |
| Hallucinated absence | §2.2 | Claimed "no tool for that" without enumerating available tools |
| Silent default | §2.2, §4 | Fell back without naming the passed-over candidate and reason |
| Shallow grounding | §3.4 | Resource was found but not substantively consulted |
| Proportionality failure | §2.1 | Overtriggering tools/subagents on trivial tasks, or undertriggering on substantive ones |
| Plan thrash | §5.9 | Re-litigating a decision without new contradicting evidence |
| Scope creep | §6.3 | Unrequested refactors, abstractions, or defensive code added |
| Test-shaped solution | §6.4 | Hardcoded to pass given test inputs, not the general case |
| State loss | §7 | Fresh context resumed without reading prior progress state |
| Unjustified delegation | §9 | Subagent spawned for a task where direct action was faster and clearer |
| DOX drift | §13.2, §13.3 | Edited files without reading the applicable AGENTS.md chain, or closed out a task without the post-edit DOX pass |
| Structural entanglement | §14.1, §14.2 | New logic added without isolating the boundary, or a flow-shaped system organized categorically instead of topologically |
| Cryptic naming | §14.3 | Files, modules, or functions named for brevity over discoverability |
| Deferred hyper-local DOX | §14.4 | New architectural boundary created without its local AGENTS.md landing in the same change |
| Legacy rewrite creep | §14.5 | Full restructure attempted on unstructured legacy code instead of walling off a perimeter around the actual change |
| Trust-without-re-execution | §9.2, §5 | Reviewer accepted an implementer's claimed results without re-running the verification battery |
| Vacuous test | §9.2 | Test passes regardless of implementation (no assertion, trivially true, exercises none of the logic it claims to pin) |
| Skeleton leak | §9.2 | `todo!`, `unimplemented!`, empty body, or placeholder left in committed code past its task |
| Inline code in plan | §8.3 | Plan contained implementation bodies; executor pasted them and stopped, producing a skeleton |
| Context dump | §9.1 | Subagent given full chat history instead of a curated bundle, polluting its output |
| Vertical slice violation | §8.3 | Task delivered a horizontal layer with nothing independently verifiable until later tasks land |

## 12. Conventional Commits Specification

All git commits in this repository must strictly adhere to the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](conventionalcommits.md) standard located at [`conventionalcommits.md`](conventionalcommits.md).

### 12.1 Format Schema

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### 12.2 Allowed Types

| Type | SemVer | Purpose / Domain | Example |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `feat` | `MINOR` | New agent- or user-facing feature or trading capability | `feat(risk): implement dynamic liquidation distance monitor` |
| `fix` | `PATCH` | Bug fix in calculations, state machines, or execution logic | `fix(ingest): handle reconnect backoff on binance ws drop` |
| `perf` | `PATCH` | Performance optimization without functional interface change | `perf(simd): vectorize OFI and microprice calculation kernel` |
| `refactor` | — | Code reorganization that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature | `refactor(core): extract lock-free ring buffer into SPSC module` |
| `docs` | — | Documentation updates only (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, docstrings) | `docs(spec): document 4-way basis decomposition formula` |
| `test` | — | Adding missing tests, property tests, or correcting test assertions | `test(alloc): add generative proptests for PPO invariant bounds` |

| `chore` | — | Routine housekeeping, repo cleanup, scripts, tooling setup | `chore(init): configure workspace gitignore and repo metadata` |

### 12.3 Modular Scope Guidelines

Scopes map directly to system domains in the Fracture workspace:
- `core`: Core primitives, POMDP state models, price math, numerical embeddings
- `risk`: Top-down allocator, dynamic leverage scaling, liquidation distance, stop-loss guards
- `ingest`: Binance WS, QuickNode gRPC, local node parser, order book reconciliation
- `exec`: EIP-712 signing, priority fee injection, ALO/IOC dispatch, cancellation engine
- `sim`: Tick replayer, latency perturbation, fill simulator, capacity curve modeling
- `dox`: Specifications, blueprints, guidelines, and agent instructions

### 12.4 Breaking Changes Protocol

Breaking changes (correlating with SemVer `MAJOR`) must be indicated by:
1. An exclamation mark `!` directly before the colon:
   ```text
   feat(core)!: migrate order book delta format to typed fixed-point integers
   ```
2. Or an explicit footer starting with `BREAKING CHANGE:`:
   ```text
   BREAKING CHANGE: change PPO allocation signature to require explicit maintenance rate lookup
   ```

### 12.5 Writing Rules

- **Imperative Subject**: Write descriptions in the imperative, present tense ("add", not "added" or "adds").
- **Case & Punctuation**: Lowercase description, no trailing period.
- **Separation**: A blank line MUST separate the subject from the body, and the body from footers.
- **Body**: For non-trivial commits, include a concise body explaining motivation, architectural design, and invariant guarantees.

## 13. Project Structure & Documentation Hierarchy (DOX)

§§1–11 govern how you reason and act, generically, in any repository. This section governs
how *this* project's structure is documented and kept current: DOX, the AGENTS.md hierarchy
installed here. DOX is binding, not advisory — treat every AGENTS.md in the tree as a work
contract for its subtree, per §1's precedence rule (closer-to-cwd overrides root, but
override means refine, not contradict).

### 13.1 Core Contract

- Every AGENTS.md file is a binding work contract for its subtree.
- Work products, source materials, instructions, records, assets, and durable docs must
  stay understandable from the nearest applicable AGENTS.md plus every parent AGENTS.md
  above it.
- No child AGENTS.md may weaken a rule set by a parent; a child may only add local
  specificity.

### 13.2 Read Before Editing

Before touching any file:

1. Read the root AGENTS.md.
2. Identify every file or folder you expect to touch.
3. Walk from the repository root to each target path.
4. Read every AGENTS.md found along each route.
5. If a parent AGENTS.md lists a child AGENTS.md whose scope contains the path, read that
   child and continue from there.
6. Use the nearest AGENTS.md as the local contract; parent docs supply repo-wide rules.
7. If docs conflict, the closer doc controls local work details — but no child doc may
   weaken DOX itself.

Do not rely on memory of a prior session's DOX read. Re-read the applicable chain in the
current session before editing — this is a specific instance of §7.3's fresh-context
bootstrap, scoped to documentation rather than task state.

### 13.3 Update After Editing

Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done. Update the closest
owning AGENTS.md when a change affects:

- purpose, scope, ownership, or responsibilities
- durable structure, contracts, workflows, or operating rules
- required inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, or artifacts
- user preferences about behavior, communication, process, organization, or quality
- AGENTS.md creation, deletion, move, rename, or index contents

Update parent docs when parent-level structure, ownership, workflow, or child index
changes; update child docs when parent changes alter local rules. Remove stale or
contradictory text immediately — do not defer it to a future pass. Small edits that do not
change behavior or contracts may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass itself (checking
whether an update is needed) still must happen every time.

### 13.4 Hierarchy

- Root AGENTS.md is the DOX rail: project-wide instructions, global preferences, durable
  workflow rules, and the top-level Child DOX Index.
- Child AGENTS.md files own domain-specific instructions and their own Child DOX Index.
- Each parent explains what its direct children cover and what stays owned by the parent.
- The closer a doc is to the work, the more specific and practical it must be.

### 13.5 Child Doc Shape

Create a child AGENTS.md when a folder becomes a durable boundary with its own purpose,
rules, responsibilities, workflow, materials, or quality standards — not for every folder
reflexively. An unjustified child doc is unrequested structure, the same failure §6.3
guards against for code: minimum complexity that solves the current organizational need,
not scaffolding for a boundary that doesn't exist yet.

Default section order for a child doc:

1. Purpose
2. Ownership
3. Local Contracts
4. Work Guidance
5. Verification
6. Child DOX Index

Work Guidance must reflect the current standards of the project or user instructions;
leave it empty if none exist yet. Verification must reflect an existing check; leave it
empty until one exists — do not fabricate a verification step to fill the section.

### 13.6 Style

- Keep docs concise, current, and operational.
- Document stable contracts, not diary entries.
- Put broad rules in parent docs, concrete details in child docs.
- Prefer direct bullets with explicit names over prose narrative.
- Do not duplicate rules across many files unless each scope genuinely needs a local
  version.
- Delete stale notes instead of explaining history.
- Trim obvious statements, repeated rules, misplaced detail, and warnings for risks that
  no longer exist.

### 13.7 Closeout

1. Re-check changed paths against the DOX chain.
2. Update nearest owning docs and any affected parents or children.
3. Refresh every affected Child DOX Index.
4. Remove stale or contradictory text.
5. Run existing verification when relevant — this folds into the §11.2 pre-completion
   self-check as one more item, not a separate gate.
6. Report any docs intentionally left unchanged and why — same disclosure standard as
   §4's "never silently fall through."

### 13.8 User Preferences

When the user requests a durable behavior change, record it here (root) or in the
relevant child AGENTS.md — session memory alone does not persist across a fresh context.

### 13.9 Child DOX Index

<!-- Populate as child AGENTS.md files are created. One line each: -->
<!-- - `relative/path/AGENTS.md` — scope: <what subtree it owns> -->

*(empty — no child AGENTS.md registered yet)*

## 14. Codebase Structural Integrity

When operating with broad write authority — autonomous multi-file changes, no per-step
confirmation gate — directory and module structure is the only map available for a given
task. This section governs how you create and maintain that structure as a standing habit,
independent of language, framework, or project domain. It applies equally to a clean
workspace and to an unstructured legacy tree; the difference is whether you're maintaining
a boundary or drawing one for the first time.

Structure here serves navigation and blast-radius containment, not permission — §6.2's
risk-gating rules for destructive or irreversible actions are unaffected by anything below.

### 14.1 Isolation as Default

Treat every new domain, feature, or execution phase as a self-contained boundary. Expose
only what the boundary must expose; do not let internal state leak across it. Prefer a
boundary the toolchain enforces (a package, a module with private-by-default
visibility, a compiled interface) over one that exists only as convention or comment — a
convention can be silently violated three edits later; a compiler error cannot. When the
language's boundary primitive is genuinely too heavy for the size of the change, a clearly
marked internal module is an acceptable substitute — but reach for the toolchain-enforced
boundary first.

### 14.2 Topological, Not Categorical, Organization

For systems with a strong notion of execution phase or data-flow stage — where state moves
through a sequence of transformations rather than sitting in independent, freely-orderable
components — organize by position in that flow: init, dispatch, state transition, teardown,
or whatever phases the system actually has. Do not fall back to generic technical category
(`utils/`, `helpers/`, `models/`) when the system's real structure is a pipeline. A tree
organized topologically lets a future context window reconstruct the system's control flow
from the directory listing alone. A tree organized
categorically requires reading file contents to recover flow the structure should have
already encoded. This is a default for flow-shaped systems specifically, not a universal
rule — a CRUD app or a library with no meaningful execution phases is better served by
conventional feature- or layer-based grouping. Match the organizing scheme to what the
system actually is, not to a template (§4's tie-breaking principle, applied to layout).

### 14.3 Discoverability Over Brevity

Name files, modules, types, and functions for what they do, not for compactness. You
navigate primarily through search and directory traversal, not by holding the whole tree in
memory — a name that requires prior context to decode costs a failed grep and a wrong turn
every time it's encountered cold. This doesn't reach top-level project or product naming
(a project can still be called whatever it's called) — it applies to the internal
structure beneath that name. Illustrative only, not a signal about this project's actual
domain: `payments/refund_processor`, not `payments/rp`.

### 14.4 Hyper-Local DOX at Boundary Creation

When you create a new architectural boundary — a package, a module, a directory that will
hold a coherent subsystem — drop a local AGENTS.md in it immediately, in the same change,
not as a follow-up. State its purpose, what it protects, and any hard contract at that
boundary (illustrative only, not this project's actual domain — e.g., "does not alter the
public interface exposed to callers outside this directory; external consumers route
through the designated entry point"). This is §13.5's
Child Doc Shape applied at the moment of creation rather than after the fact — the trigger
for a child AGENTS.md is boundary creation itself, not a
later documentation pass. Keep it scoped to that boundary; don't push local contracts up
into the root doc, and don't make the root doc responsible for knowledge that only matters
two directories down.

### 14.5 Legacy Containment

When modifying a project that predates any of the above — no enforced module boundaries,
categorical dirs, inconsistent naming — do not restructure the whole tree to fix it. Draw a
perimeter around the specific area you're changing: isolate the new logic behind a clear interface,
even if the interface's other side is still unstructured legacy code. Extend the
well-structured perimeter incrementally on later passes rather than attempting a one-shot
rewrite that increases blast radius on a system you don't yet have full state coverage for.
This is §6.3's anti-overengineering discipline applied in the other direction: the
constraint isn't "don't add unrequested structure," it's "don't let the absence of existing
structure justify skipping the structure this specific change needs."

### 14.6 Fast Feedback as a Structural Requirement

Structural boundaries are only as good as the feedback loop that enforces them. Before
relying on isolation to contain a change, confirm a fast, non-interactive check exists —
a compile or type-check step, a targeted test run, a lint pass — that will surface a boundary violation
immediately rather than at review time. If no such check exists for a legacy project,
establishing one is a prerequisite for §14.5, not an optional nicety: without it,
"isolated" is just a claim, not a verified property.
